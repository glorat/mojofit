Felt like a zombie walking in.\n\nNo issues on squat warmups this time. I went for my newly established routine of 1 set beltless and subsequent belted. 1 set I lost balance because I didn't sit back enough. With confidence lost, I committed to doing 3 reps a set and felt better after that. Unfortunately, I strained my left internal rotator cuff again trying to keep the bar up. Don't know what I'm doing... I think I did it on my 2nd set with the bar slipping. Chalk on the 3rd set helped - I'll do that going forward.\n\nLooking at this video and comparing to previous, I'm clearly hitting parallel this time. Knees are as before, I'll need to deload before addressing those. While I'm keeping my lower back neutral (no more lower back pain!) it seems I'm losing the bar ahead of my centre of gravity and using thoracic extension to bring the bar back (aka \"chest up\"). That's probably not good either but no pain and bigger muscles than lower back. I'm also not sitting back enough on the first rep due to nerves on the heavy weight.

Ultimately, not the time to push my body even though the pain is ignorable.\n\nThis was a rare morning workout (since I've missed the week so far and had to do something). After squat fail, I ran out of motivation to continue.\n\nAnd it's funny how when I don't exercise my body weight dropped. I weighed 63.2kg this morning. Geez \n\n"},{"date":"1398470400000","body":{"unit":"kg","weight":"65"},"notes":"Competition lifts! Weighed in at 63.6kg. Frankly too light... I need to eat more but it also doesn't help I haven't properly trained for 2 weeks. And I think that hurt my lifts today.\n\nLeft hip/groin is still acheing in warm-up but decided to simply ignore it today and suffer the consequences. As it turns out, it didn't get in the way but will see if I get an adverse reaction tomorrow. I made my goal of beating my PB lift 2 with a grinder. Wisely only went for 2kg more but was already drained from the previous grinder.\n\nSquat 118kg\n\n\nAfter warm up for bench, I felt good. Unfortunately, the weights were in LBs and I miscalculated everything. Again. My opener was accidentally matching my last PB, fortunately it went it up easy. Not realising it was a PB already, the next jump was too much. I should have attempted 68kg first. I got stuck at the bottom and that was that. I guess I wasn't expecting much improvement since I haven't properly trained bench since my last 1 rep attempt.\n\nBench 66kg\n\n\nOpened deadlifts with a bit above my training max and went fine. I almost had a false start at 124kg. But remembered the trick at screaming before lifting and it was just about okay. I knew I didn't have much left in me so conservatively went for 126kg. Apologies for the scream on the video - but it helped and the big grinder went up.\nDeadlift 126kg\n\n\nOverall, disappointed I haven't made bigger gains. I might have lifted more 2 weeks back but the hip issue has set me back a bit so I'm happy my PBs are going up. \n\n","actions":[{"name":"Barbell Squat","sets":[{"weight":"111","kg":"111","unit":"kg","reps":"1"},{"weight":"118","kg":"118","unit":"kg","reps":"1"},{"unit":"kg","reps":"0","weight":"120","kg":"120"}]},{"name":"Bench Press","sets":[{"reps":"1","unit":"kg","kg":"66","weight":"66"},{"weight":"70","kg":"70","reps":"0","unit":"kg"},{"weight":"70","kg":"70","reps":"0","unit":"kg"}]},{"name":"Barbell Deadlift","sets":[{"reps":"1","unit":"kg","weight":"118","kg":"118"},{"unit":"kg","reps":"1","weight":"124","kg":"124"},{"kg":"126","weight":"126","unit":"kg","reps":"1"}]}]},{"body":{"unit":"kg","weight":"65"},"notes":"A mess around workout after Saturday's efforts. I wouldn't have even gone to the gym except my girlfriend insisted on going (!!). She did 5x5 60kg squats so beat me on volume today :). My CNS still felt a little fritzy.\n\nI was sure I was going to press 48kg but got stuck at head height. Damn. Will try again on Sunday ;)\n\nAnd my new favourite accessory workout is the Farmers walk. Carrying 60kg around the gym! It particularly works core and grip, two things I'm a little weak on. And it's a great functional movement. Went 37 and 47 seconds - I need to get up to 60 seconds :)\n\nI went for a self-run self-assessment of my left hip. With help of my anatomy research, I think it's actually a groin muscle injury after all, now that I know my notoriously tight adductors attach at the groin. I went with a bunch of self-massage of the deep tissue and today the squats were not quite so irritating. Banded hip openers seem to help too. Might get better soon after all. And my elbows don't hurt. Nor do I have any lower back pain whatsoever.

Today was a lot of fun and picked up a few crucial tips specifically for me to play with.\n\nSquats\nNarrower stance involves less adductors, which is helpful if you have a groin strain like I do. In fact, it seems to benefit my lifts as my knees were more stable today\nShoulder width stance is narrower than one might think!\nStay balanced on the midfoot. I \"know\" this but might not always practice it\nTighter back - I watch Mehdi go around fixing people's setup. I realise I can get tighter - the weight is instantly lighter when tight on setup\nDeadlifts\nHip width stance. @Tobin Thomas - you were right all along to point this out! I was always too wide. As a result...\nVertical arms - which needs to be outside your narrow legs\nThere is a fine line between staying calm with deep breaths, or getting the aggressiveness into the lift. In my case, that involves screaming!\nI learned a trick to involve the stretch reflex in the deadlift. I don't and won't consciously use that yet but it's something to pull out of the future armoury.\nDrop the weight back to the same place between reps by bending at the hips instead of the knees\nReassuringly, I didn't have any major flaws in my technique highlighted so hopefully, I can just keep going. As it was, I went for PRs and made every lift I attempted today. And each PR was noticeable easier and of better form than last week\n\nHappy to make the 120kg squat I missed out on last week\nSquat 120kg\n\n\nAnd a slightly than louder roar, which silenced the room, got me the 2x BW deadlift I was after\nDeadlift 130kg\n\n\nFinished off with some Oly lifts. Some of the CF coaches there were reasonably knowledgeable and gave me various tips on the positioning for the pieces of the clean. I have a lot to learn there.

It's not good for me.\n\nI only had 45 minutes for today's gym session so rushed the bench press. It wasn't hard but no time to focus.\n\nMy thought of the day from Melbourne... training amongst people, with a training partner or a group forces you to focus. I don't focus enough when I'm alone. In Melbourne, I thought it was just adrenaline that made me lift more. Actually, my form was simply better in Melbourne, not because I was being told to fix stuff but because I had incentive to focus. I still marvel at how good my OHP looks on video, compared to my training lifts!\n\nStill, knowing that focus when training alone is an issue, I can try to address it.
