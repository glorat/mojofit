My warm-up squats included pause reps at the end. At 60kg, they feel okay and should be useful.\n\nPause squats with breathing are really interesting! I tried doing 40kg pause and breathe reps. I could only manage sets of 1/3/1. The first rep surprised me as my adductors tightened up and burned. So that's why my stretch reflex comes in to bring my knees in on the way up! I also learned my abs aren't really all that engaged at the bottom after all - valsalva is doing all the work.\n\nThere does some to be something about using a breathing pause squat as a diagnostic tool for core tightness.

Thumbless does seem to help get accurate drive straight through the forearms without wrists bending. But I'm still used to thumbs over where I can grip the bar harder and generate more shoulder torque. On the fence. Was really annoyed I missed the last rep.

But it turned out this was a productive fear. On another day, I might have bailed on that 1st rep of the second set where I missed the hip bounce and got stuck on the way up. Determined not to fail, I ground it out and still made the remaining 4 reps!\n\nOn reflection, my 107kg effort was not even maximal. And no after effects. I must conclude I'm now the strongest I've ever been :)\n\nBench is progressing well too now. 54kg was easy. I've been figuring out what bench accessory to do... Inspired by Mehdi's emails about \"bench more\", I also got inspired by the 5/3/1 program @Jesse Frigo and @Tobin Thomas are doing where they do BBB accessory work which seems to involve 50-60% for 10 reps.

As a result...\nVertical arms - which needs to be outside your narrow legs\nThere is a fine line between staying calm with deep breaths, or getting the aggressiveness into the lift.

It's not good for me.\n\nI only had 45 minutes for today's gym session so rushed the bench press. It wasn't hard but no time to focus.\n\nMy thought of the day from Melbourne... training amongst people, with a training partner or a group forces you to focus. I don't focus enough when I'm alone. In Melbourne, I thought it was just adrenaline that made me lift more. Actually, my form was simply better in Melbourne, not because I was being told to fix stuff but because I had incentive to focus. I still marvel at how good my OHP looks on video, compared to my training lifts!\n\nStill, knowing that focus when training alone is an issue, I can try to address it.

Learned a bunch of little things with these guys! Workout wise, I went for C1W3 Squats that I missed last time - and everything else was a bonus for learning technique\n\nSquats - even with the belt, I'm badly over-extending my mid-back. This is seriously not good as I'm going to hurt myself doing this and need to fix it. I don't know what to directly do about this but I also say the physio today who, without knowing about my squatting, identified my APT, weak glutes, short hip flexors, overworked abductors and propensity to overarch. A blessing to have good medical help for once. I'll try to address that in the mean time. And do planks. Video to come.\n\nPress - Jalpesh/Bruce both pointed out I'm still overextending my back and not engaging my abs enough. They are right, my upper back doesn't feel great, especially after the squats.\n\nPlank - I barely survived 60 seconds! Bruce and Jalpesh did a plank challenge - both lasted a little over 3 minutes. Jalpesh lost to a 60 year old... haha. (Okay so did I). As I moved to do pause squats, my right ab cramped. D'oh! I'm a weakling.\n\nPause squats - brought these back in but they are engaging my overworked abductors at the bottom rather than my core so not sure if this the best assistance for me.\n\nBench - It turns out I'm messing up the shoulder setting/breaking the bar. Bruce got me to set my shoulders properly with my upper back/lats. Wow, it's different! More stable but because I'm not used to it, I tired out fast. I really need to learn this. Also got my bench stance videod and corrected. I didn't realise I was out there too! I was only benching 20kg but this was really useful. Thanks guys!\n\nNutrition - Both Bruce and Jalpesh totally out do my on getting their calories and protein. Eggs eggs eggs. I must eat more eggs. No excuses about crappy food in Shanghai - they have eggs there. I need to eat them. Lots of them.\n\nMobility - Physio mobilised my ankle that has lost dorsiflexion ROM since I sprained the ankle two years ago, making me more likely to valgus on that side. Give me typical PT style strengthening exercises for my glutes. But I learned how to do the couch stretch properly! The back must be flattened out for it to work properly - i.e. counter my natural tendency to arch my lower back. This is a really valuable tip.\n\nSo much learned!

I used the session to try to figure out why the hell I'm overextending my still sore back. Tried to keep it flat at 60kg, filmed it but was still overextended! Repeated again, slowly with pauses... lower back still getting tired. Tried again, really trying to flex my abs and basically reverse my APT by tucking the pelvis. This time it was my abs burning to hold position after a mere 2 reps at 50kg. WTF? Are my abs really that weak??\n\nBasically, I need to do more exercises to fix APT. It's half muscle imbalances and half just motor control neural patterning - it seems I'm too used to shifting my squat power to my hip flexors and adductors, not engaging my abs and glutes. I'm a Donald Duck. \n\n"},{"actions":[{"sets":[{"reps":"5","kg":"30"},{"reps":"5","kg":"35"},{"reps":"8","kg":"37.5"},{"reps":"7","kg":"30"}],"name":"Standing Barbell Shoulder Press (OHP)"},{"sets":[{"reps":"10","kg":"40"},{"reps":"10","kg":"40"},{"reps":"10","kg":"40"}],"name":"Lat Pulldown"},{"sets":[{"reps":"10","kg":"20"},{"reps":"10","kg":"20"},{"reps":"10","kg":"20"},{"reps":"10","kg":"20"},{"reps":"10","kg":"20"}],"name":"Bench Press"}],"date":"1403568000","notes":"My back is still sore from overarching on squats last week.

Usually something gets sore after Squats AMRAP. Last workout, it was the hips. Previous, it was adductors. Before that, quads. Previously... back. It's interesting how some weakness gets hit, the body adapts, and the weak chain moves on. All the while, the est 1RM keeps going up! \n\n"},{"actions":[{"sets":[{"reps":"5","kg":"89"},{"reps":"9","kg":"98"},{"reps":"3","kg":"109"},{"reps":"5","kg":"109"},{"reps":"5","kg":"89"}],"name":"Barbell Deadlift"},{"sets":[{"reps":"3","kg":"89"},{"reps":"3","kg":"89"},{"reps":"3","kg":"89"}],"name":"Speed Deadlift"},{"sets":[{"reps":"5","kg":"5"},{"reps":"5","kg":"3"}],"name":"Pullup"},{"sets":[{"reps":"5","kg":"55"},{"reps":"5","kg":"55"}],"name":"Paused banded squats"}],"date":"1408924800","notes":"C4W1 Deadlift - Gaah... my hand fails me again.

The whole bend the bar thing wasn't happening and then the penny dropped... I had been gripping the bar incorrectly! I suddenly remembered Rippetoe's instructions to turn the hands inwards slightly. That's all it took! This allows more torque/external rotation in the shoulders and helps prevent the wrists from rolling back.

Instead, go heavy then do a whole bunch of accessories, stealing ideas from the Coan/Philippi program. If I ever get the time and concentration, I might run that program for real.\n\nThis was my first go at halting deadlifts - and took a very conservative weight. The theory is that this will practice getting the bar off the ground, which is usually my weaker part. It's definitely less taxing than a full deadlift and I was fine doing them despite having already done 6 proper deadlift sets. But it is still good practice. I think this will be new in my repertoire. It will be interesting if I can practice heavy on these. \n\n"}]
